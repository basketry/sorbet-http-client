# Ruby/Sorbey HTTP Client

[Basketry generator](https://github.com/basketry) generator for generating HTTP clients implemented in Ruby/Sorbet. This generator can be coupled with any Basketry pipeline. It is recommended to use this generator alongside the [`@basketry/sorbet`](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet) generator.

## Quick Start

The following example converts a "Swagger" doc into [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) types:

1. Save `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` as `petstore.json` in the root of your project.
1. Install packages: `npm install -g basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/sorbet @basketry/sorbet-http-client`
1. Generate code: `basketry --source petstore.json --parser @basketry/swagger-2 --generators @basketry/sorbet @basketry/sorbet-http-client --output src`

When the last step is run, basketry will parse the source file (`petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator writing the output folder (`src`).

## Folder Structure

Example config without options:

```json
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/sorbet", "@basketry/sorbet-http-client"],
  "output": ""
}
```

Resulting output:

```
my_project/
├─ app/
│  ├─ lib/
│  │  ├─ petstore/
│  │  │  ├─ v1/
│  │  │  │  ├─ http_client_helpers.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ pets_http_client.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ stores_http_client.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ users_http_client.rb
├─ .gitattributes
├─ basketry.config.json
├─ petstore.json
```

## Options

All Rails generator options are namespaced within a `sorbet` property. This generator's options include all options accepted by `@basketry/sorbet`. For this reason, it is recommended that all `sorbet` options be defined as common options to ensure that code generated by all sorbet-related generators use the same module and folder structure conventions.

Example config:

```json
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/sorbet", "@basketry/sorbet-validators"],
  "output": "",
  "options": {
    "sorbet": {
      "lib": "app/lib"
    }
  }
}
```

### `lib`

This setting lets you specify where the client files will be written within a rails application. If not specified, the default is `app/lib`.

Example usage:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "sorbet": {
      "lib": "app/services"
    }
  }
}
```

## Snapshots

An example of generated HTTP client code can be found as a test snapshot at [`/src/snapshot/`](./src/snapshot/).

## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet-validators/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
